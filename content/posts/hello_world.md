## This is a reboot

In a previous life, I used to create content in a blog: https://adioss.fr 

Too much other stuff to do, no more time to maintain... I stopped. 

I will try to reboot this practice with a simpler stack:
* [hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/about/)
* free hosting using github pages (in https://github.com/adioss/adioss.github.io): 
    * deploy on commit using actions 
    * add comments using
    
Let's see if I can produce valuable content.
